# Online-PlayPicker

## Development
- Install dependencies: `npm install`
- Run locally: `npm run dev`
- Build locally: `npm run build`

## Deployment (Vercel)
- Build command: `npm run vercel-build`
- Output directory: `team-picker/dist`
- Vite root is configured to `team-picker`, so the production assets land in that subfolder. Ensure Vercel `outputDirectory` matches.
